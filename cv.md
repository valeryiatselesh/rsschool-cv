Hey, I am Valeryia, young front-end developer. My main goal is to acquire new knowledge and improve my current skills in order to become a specialist who can independently complete any type of tasks. I am constantly reading specialized literature, taking courses, watching training videos and, most importantly, applying my knowledge on personal projects. I also have experience in manual testing and IT project management. Currently, I am studying JavaScript and React in depth.
